AvocadoBot
==========

The Avocado computer bot.

I have a passion for malware, so this is my attempt at writing a benign botnet, features include everything aside from propogation.
The AvocadoBot is for academic purposes only, it will give a basic template on which future PoC code can be integrated easily due to high levels of modularization.


Building
--------
AvocadoBot is meant to be built in Linux or Windows, using Visual Studio.

Linux has a Makefile. 

There also exists a Visual Studio Solution file for Windows. 

AvocadoBot is tested and run primarily in Wine.
