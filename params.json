{"name":"AvocadoBot","tagline":"C++ IRC bot with advanced system controls","body":"### What is AvocadoBot?\r\nAvocadoBot is an modular bot programmed in C++ targeted for Windows.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nI have a passion for malware and modern techniques used in the wild. It's rare to find the source code for an information stealing botnet, especially one that is written well and commented. Hopefully AvocadoBot can serve as a guide for anyone interested in how a botnet works under the hood.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal here?\r\nCreating a skeletal bot that can be easily modified with Proof of Concept code and exploits. Anti-detection techniques will make little appearance to focus on a broad set of controls on the host.\r\n\r\n### Isn't this illegal?\r\nNo, I have zero intention of releasing malicious features. This bot is very simple compared to most criminal malware, it would be extremely easy to detect.\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nAll pull requests for bug fixes are welcome. However, should someone want to work on adding features, please contact @mbreedlove.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
