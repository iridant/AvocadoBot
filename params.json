{"name":"AvocadoBot","body":"### What is AvocadoBot?\r\nAvocadoBot is an IRC bot programmed in C++ targeted for Windows.\r\n\r\n### What is the goal here?\r\nNothing. The only goal here is to learn about what things are required to build a robust functional IRC bot.\r\n\r\n### Isn't this illegal?\r\nHonestly, I'm not sure. I have absolutely ZERO intention of ever adding malicious features such as the ability to spread to other computers using an exploit.\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nAll pull requests for bug fixes are welcome. However, should someone want to work on adding features, please contact @mbreedlove.\r\n","tagline":"C++ IRC bot with advanced system controls","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
